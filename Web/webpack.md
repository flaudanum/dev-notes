## Basic setup

Excerpt from [Bhargav Bachina](https://medium.com/@bhargavbachina?source=follow_footer--------------------------follow_footer-)'s
[post in Medium](https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/how-to-write-production-ready-node-js-rest-api-javascript-version-db64d3941106).

Once development is complete, we need to bundle our app and deploy into other
environments like stage,uat and prod etc. Letâ€™s add webpack to our project to
bundle the entire app files into a single file.

Webpack's setup requires to run some `npm install` commands:

Global install
```
$ npm install -g webpack
```

Project installs as dev dependencies
```
$ npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```

Add this line in the *scripts* section in file `package.json`:
```json
"build": "webpack"
```

Add the `webpack.config.js` where you mention starting file and output
directory and the target is important because our runtime environment is node.
```javascript
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './index.js',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'api.bundle.js'
  },
  target: 'node'
};
```

When running the command below, webpack will build the entire project into
single bundle file and place that in the target folder mentioned in the
`webpack.config.js`:

```
npm run build
```

After completion of the build, let's add the following `npm` script to the
*scripts* section in the `package.json`:

```json
"prod": "node dist/api.bundle.js"
```

and run the command:

```npm
$ npm run prod
```

## Webpack CLI

### Initialize a new configuration script

<b style="color:red">BUG:</b> This functionality is currently bugged.
See [issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli/issues/1127)

Use `webpack-cli init` and answer the questions. If webpack is installed as a project dependency:
```
$ npx webpack-cli init
```

### Build with stats data
```
$ npx webpack-cli --profile --json > compilation-stats.json
```

## Other webpack tools

### Analyze a bundle

```
$ npm install webpack-bundle-analyzer
```
Use the script for analyzing the dependencies packed in the bundle.
```
$ npx webpack-bundle-analyzer compilation-stats.json ./dist
```
A web page with an awesome dependency graph opens.
